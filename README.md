# Date-Sorter
Task\
The implementation of this method should sort dates. \
The output should be in the following order: \
Dates with an 'r' in the month, \
sorted ascending (first to last), \
then dates without an 'r' in the month, \
sorted descending (last to first). \
For example, October dates would come before May dates, \
because October has an 'r' in it. \
thus: (2005-07-01, 2005-01-02, 2005-01-01, 2005-05-03) \
would sort to \
(2005-01-01, 2005-01-02, 2005-07-01, 2005-05-03)
